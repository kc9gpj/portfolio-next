        <p>A lifelong experimenter, tinkerer, and world traveler. Since I was young I have enjoyed building computers,
          designing radio antennas, and experimenting with technology. I also enjoy camping, hunting, and a variety of
          nerd culture.</p>
        <p className="mb-0">I grew up in the great state of Wisconsin, and I currently live near Kansas City. I graduated
          from Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois in 2012 with a Bachelor of Science. After that I spent 4 years
          in the Army as a Logistics Officer. The majority of my service was at Fort Riley, KS and southern
          Afghanistan.</p>
